Dijkstra's Algorithm

Finds the shortest distance to all other nodes.
Weights must be positive.

Mark all vert distance as infinity 
Mark source distance as 0
Push all vertices to a priority queue (PQ)
While PQ is not empty 
	pop PQ into V1
	for all adjacent vertices (V2)
		newDistance = V1.Distance + (V1,V2).Distance
		if newDistance < V2.Distance
			V2.Distance = NewDistance

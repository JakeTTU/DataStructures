## Basic Data Structures implemented in C++

### Notes:

Time complexity of NP Complete reduction - polynomial time

NP Complete problems (typically exponential complexity) - Traveling Salesmen problem, Knapsack problem, Hamiltonian path problem

Time Complexity
Linked list operations -  order N
Balanced BST - order log(n)
Worst case BST - order N
Heap insert/remove - log(n)
Queue push/pop w/o tail - order N
Queue push/pop w/ tail - constant time
Stack push/pop - constant time

Inserting to heap:
Insert at next position
Upheap

Removing from heap:
Replace root with last inserted
Downheap

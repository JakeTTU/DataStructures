Doubly linked lists is a list of nodes that stores 3 things, data, pointer to successor, and pointer to predecessor. 

One advantage a doubly linked list has is that the nodes store both pointers to successors and predecessors. This allows us to add and delete from both the head and tail, and search for elements from either the head or tail.

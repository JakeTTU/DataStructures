## Basic Data Structures implemented in C++

### Notes:

Time complexity of NP Complete reduction - polynomial time
NP Complete problems (typically exponential complexity) - Traveling Salesmen problem, Knapsack problem, Hamiltonian path problem

Time Complexity:<br>
Linked list operations -  order N<br>
Balanced BST - order log(N)<br>
Worst case BST - order N<br>
Heap insert/remove - order log(N)<br>
Queue push/pop w/o tail - order N<br>
Queue push/pop w/ tail - constant time<br>
Stack push/pop - constant time<br>

Inserting to heap:<br>
Insert at next position<br>
Upheap<br>

Removing from heap:<br>
Replace root with last inserted<br>
Downheap
